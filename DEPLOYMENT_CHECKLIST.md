- [ ] Add Railway domain to authorized redirect URIs:
  - `https://your-app-name.railway.app/auth/google/callback`

### 4. Deploy
- [ ] Railway will automatically build and deploy
- [ ] Monitor build logs for any errors
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete

### 5. Test Deployment
- [ ] Visit your Railway URL
- [ ] Test user registration
- [ ] Test user login
- [ ] Test Google OAuth login
- [ ] Test place browsing
- [ ] Test booking functionality
- [ ] Test admin panel (if applicable)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails:
1. Check Railway logs
2. Verify all dependencies are in package.json
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly

### If App Doesn't Load:
1. Check if backend is running
2. Verify MongoDB connection
3. Check CORS settings

### If OAuth Doesn't Work:
1. Verify Google OAuth redirect URIs
2. Check environment variables
3. Ensure HTTPS is enabled
